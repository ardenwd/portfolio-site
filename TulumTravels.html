          Craving an international experience with a low cost, me and my friends
          met up in Cancun for our overlapping breaks from school. Passing the
          manicured sorority girls in security at the Atlanta airport at 6am, I
          was grateful that my friends and I were heading to a place farther off
          the beaten path.
        </p>
        <p class="body">
          Before the night was over, me and my friends had met at the airport,
          rode a bus, a tuk tuk, and finally a ferry to reach Isla Mujeres, a
          lovely little island off the coast of Cancun. Here we met other
          travelers, played with puppies at a local animal shelter, and found
          ourselves learning about the island from the owner of the breakfast
          place we frequented. This map explores where we went, how we got
          there, and when we were together.

          As the group split, our impression of the region shifted. Walking to
          our hotel in Tulum, Katie and I were immediately confronted by the
          deep poverty in Tulum bordering the tourist hotel zone. We stayed in a
          newly built, instagrammable, security guarded apartment complex that
          stood juxtaposed to the tents with dirt floors set up one street away.
          Suspicious that census data may not reliably provide insight into the
          wealth disparities of the town with so many transient occupants, I
          sought out other data to provide insight into the developing
          infrastructure of the town.

          This map uses data about the cell service availability in different
          areas of tulum. In a town known for its tourism, this map draws
          attention to the ethics of gentrification and travel. While the areas
          with the highest quality cell service are the downtown area and “hotel
          zone”, the areas that completely lack service, specifically that hole
          in the center, is where hundreds of people live in dirt-floored
          shacks. I marked the roads Katie and I frequented to highlight the
          infrastructure designed around tourists. It would be interesting to
          include the daily paths of those living in these settlements to
          introduce an alternative perspective to this conversation, revealing
          the blind-spots city planners, governmental organizations, and
          tourists overlook.
