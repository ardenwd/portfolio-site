          First thing in the morning, I head to a quiet conference room. I
          always bring the energy - and my thermos. Flying through the agenda, I
          lead the meeting like a caffeine-fueled cheerleader. Hours later,
          between sips of cold brew, I endlessly chatter during a class-wide
          discussion on experimental film. Walking to the library after class, I
          feel what I can only describe as an overwhelming sense of inspiration
          and joy. As I settle into my seat, my wild ideas manifest into jitters
          and I’m unable to focus. “What’s going on with me?” I wonder as I
          struggle to get to sleep at night.
        </p>
        <p class="body">
          Caffeine. It runs my college life. I consume it prescriptively and
          strategically drink it to improve my mood and productivity on the
          daily. But with a spike of energy being followed by a day-ruining
          crash, I wondered if there was a distinguishable correlation between
          coffee consumption and how I felt. As I began to talk to my friends,
          it seemed like it impacted them differently. “Like any drug it
          enhances my current state, so around my friends I’m in a happy mood;
          it makes me funny but alone and I’m stressed, it sends me into anxiety
          town”. With 5 coffee shops on campus, each offering a different menu
          of options, everyone has a method to the madness. One friend
          mentioned, “Caffeine from tea helps my brain, but caffeine from coffee
          makes me feel bad”. Inspired by mood diaries, me and 3 classmates
          began to collect data.
        </p>
        <h4>The Dataset</h4>
        <p class="block1 body">
          The data collection method was designed to track how caffeine habits
          cause mood fluctuations throughout the day. Participants kept a mood
          journal, taking note of mood and location every 2 hours as well as the
          times when they consumed caffeine and how much they slept the night
          before. The following is a preview of the dataset, and the rest can be
          viewed here.

        <h4>Chat GPT Data Cleaning Exploration</h4>
        <p class="block1 body">
          Rather than have a limited set of moods participants could choose from
          to define their mood, there were a number of guiding adjectives given
          to generate creative responses. The result of this was a lot of moods
          without a clear scale to define their interaction. In search for a
          scale, this metric emerged: In order to standardize the emotions in
          the dataset, I defined a few of the most common responses in
          accordance with this spectrum, then fed ChatGPT a prompt to quickly
          standardize the rest. GPT also provided me with a python script which
          I used to populate a column of mapped emotion values and format the
          dataset. The resulting and final dataset looked like this can be
          viewed fully here.

        <h4>Early Data Explorations</h4>
        <p class="block1 body">
          Using tools including tableau and Flourish, I looked for trends within
          my data to form a narrative surrounding it.

          Our moods are all over the place, filling every quadrant of the grid,
          with the majority however, being the positive in the upper right hand
          corner. Cathy expressed being tired more often and consumed caffeine
          the least amount of times.

        <h4>Exploring Difference by Person First</h4>
        <p class="block1 body">
          I noticed differences in the caffeine habits of me and my classmates.
          One classmate tended to drink large amounts of caffeine first thing in
          the morning and again in the afternoon. I tended to do so throughout
          the day, and another classmate had it only during the middle of the
          day.

        <p class="body">
          This graph illuminates the difference in when me and my classmates
          drink caffeine, and how much we drink. It also highlights that my
          moods are stronger, and that Srishti drinks large amounts of
          caffeinated beverages.

        <p class="block1 body">
          I chose to shift to an individual level, focusing on how my awakeness
          levels were altered following an increase in caffeine. I think the
          second day well illustrated a caffeine crash. This was a day where I
          had only slept 5.5 hours the night before and I drank a lot of
          caffeine in the early afternoon to mitigate tiredness. However the
          lack of sleep caught up to me and my awakeness began to decline.

        <h4>Physical Product</h4>
        <p class="block1 body">
          The final iteration of this project required a physical manifestation,
          so I chose the vessel that houses the coffee itself. Some people in my
          class highlighted the way that water bottles have found a place beyond
          simply being a source of hydration, explaining they can also be an
          attachment object and that status and personality are communicated
          with their appearance.
        </p>
        <p class="body">
          Additionally, I thought about how if you see someone drinking out of a
          thermos versus a water bottle, you expect they’ve got some hot,
          caffeinated beverage in there. What you don’t see, however, is what
          that drink is doing to them. I wanted to combine these ideas about
          communicating personality and effect of caffeine through a data
          visualization on my coffee cup. So, rather than simply printing a
          static data visualization onto my cup, I made it interactive.

          Gaining popularity in asmr videos, pop-its emerged on the market as a
          fidget toy. With the material being readily available and commonplace
          to my gen-z peers, I cut and pasted the convex dots onto the outside
          of my cup. Maintaining the language of the prior visualizations, moods
          are encoded by color, with the placement of each dot symbolizing a
          time when caffeine was consumed. Following this placement method, a
          cup could look wildly different based on the individual’s internal
          experience. By adding the interactive element, this product becomes a
          performance piece, a dance depicting the jitters.
